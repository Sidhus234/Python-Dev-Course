# Web Development

## How Web works?
A browser (google chrome, safari, firefox), type the link of website, throught internet, the browser makes a request to server (located anywhere in world). The server is a computer which can render the website. The server and our browser communicate over http/https. http/https (Secured encrypted) is a protocol for two machines to communicate. 

-- Browser makes request to server
-- Server has three files (html: text, css: styling, js: java script (gives behaviour, allows actions)
-- Server sends the three files to the browser
-- Browser understands the files, and displays the website for us

-- Python can be used to write logic and program to create a server
-- Browser is written in javascript 

-- Developer tools allow us to explore the website page files

-- If certain things need to be done over and over, packages are developed. If it requires lot of work, framework is developed to help reduce time to production
